## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diamond-price-prediction.git
cd diamond-price-prediction
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Application

Start the Flask server by running:

```bash
python application.py
```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`or localhost:5000 in your browser.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Input Features**:
   - Users provide details like `carat`, `cut`, `color`, and `clarity` through a web form.

2. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - The input is processed using a trained regression model to predict the price.

3. **Results Display**:
   - The estimated price and input details are displayed dynamically.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Details

The ML model was trained on a dataset containing detailed information about diamonds. Key techniques include:

- **Feature Engineering**: Processed features like carat, cut, and color.
- **Model Training**: Regression model trained using Scikit-learn.
- **Evaluation**: Achieved high accuracy on the test dataset.
